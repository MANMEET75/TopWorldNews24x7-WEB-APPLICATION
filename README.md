# TopWorldNews24x7-WEB-APPLICATION
I've developed a web application called TopWorldNews24x7 using node.js. The application is built using express framework, which handles user requests and responses. To retrieve the latest news from the world, I use the newAPI through https. I implemented the feature for user input with the help of body-parser. The application has an interactive UI that was designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The UI is responsive
